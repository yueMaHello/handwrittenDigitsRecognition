Machine learning problem: The Distinguishment over the Handwritten Digits.
Collaborate with Yiding Fan.

Three different algorithms(Naive Bayes, Logistic Classification and Neural Network) are used as the methodologies.The results of   different algorithms are compared. As the sources for Naive Bayes and Neural Network, the scikit learning package provides a convenient   API. Logistic Regression is implemented based on the previous assignment.
